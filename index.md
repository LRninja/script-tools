# Welcome to the LRninja's Script-tools GitHub Page 

This is my catch all for tools I'm tinkering with. Feel free to browse and be inspired, or just get a good chuckle. These are all a work in progress. Much like yourself, don't take them too seriously. You can probably do a better job, so have at it! Pick up your favorite shell, editor or IDE and code the night away. That is, unless you have an important appointment in the morning, but hey... its your life. 

## Learn continuously, practice often, do good, love and live it well! 

Here's a little inspiration from one of my fav's:
```python3

inspiredBy = "Monte {}".format("Python")

print("This scripting language was "[-1] + inspiredBy)

 - [x] learn continuously
 - [x] operate with the heart of a teacher
 - [ ] inspire others to do the same
